                2-3 eggs
                Salt, to taste
                Black pepper, to taste
                Butter or oil, for cooking
                Fillings (optional):
                Grated cheese
                Chopped vegetables (e.g., bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, spinach)
                Cooked meats (e.g., ham, bacon, sausage)
                Herbs (e.g., parsley, chives)
                Instructions:
                
                Prepare Fillings (if using): If you're adding fillings like vegetables or meats, chop them into small pieces and cook them beforehand if necessary. Set aside.
                
                Beat Eggs: Crack the eggs into a bowl. Season with salt and black pepper. Beat the eggs with a fork or whisk until well combined and slightly frothy.
                
                Heat Pan: Place a non-stick skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil and let it heat up.
                
                Cook Eggs: Once the pan is hot, pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. Allow the eggs to cook for a minute or two until the edges start to set.
                
                Add Fillings (if using): Sprinkle your desired fillings over one half of the omelette.
                
                Fold Omelette: Using a spatula, carefully fold the other half of the omelette over the side with the fillings. Press down gently to seal.
                
                Cook Until Set: Let the omelette cook for another minute or two until it's fully set and cooked through. You can gently press down on the top with the spatula to ensure even cooking.
                
                Serve: Slide the omelette onto a plate and serve hot. You can garnish with additional herbs or grated cheese if desired.</p></td>

                Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
                Instructions:
                
                Heat Oil: Heat oil or ghee in a karahi (wok) or a deep frying pan over medium heat.
                
                Sauté Onion: Add chopped onions to the hot oil and sauté until they turn translucent and golden brown.
                
                Add Spices: Add cumin seeds to the onions and sauté for a few seconds until they release their aroma. Then add ginger garlic paste and sauté until the raw smell disappears.

                1 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1 teaspoon garam masala powder
                Salt to taste
                For Rice:
                
                2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes
                Water for boiling rice
                Salt to taste
                Whole spices (2-3 cloves, 2-3 green cardamom pods, 1-inch cinnamon stick)
                1 bay leaf
                For Biryani Masala:
                
                2 onions, thinly sliced
                2 tomatoes, chopped
                2 green chilies, slit lengthwise
                1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves
                1/4 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
                1/2 cup fried onions (optional)
                1/4 cup oil or ghee
                Few saffron strands soaked in 2 tablespoons warm milk (optional)
                Instructions:
                
                Marinate the Chicken:
                
                In a bowl, mix yogurt, ginger garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, and salt.
                Add chicken pieces to the marinade, coat them well, cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, preferably longer for better flavor.
                Prepare the Rice:
                
                In a large pot, bring water to a boil.
                Add soaked basmati rice, salt, whole spices, and bay leaf.
                Cook the rice until it is about 70% cooked (it should still have a slight bite to it). Drain the rice and set aside.
                Prepare Biryani Masala:
                
                Heat oil or ghee in a large pot or deep pan.
                Add sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove some fried onions for garnish, if desired.
                Add chopped tomatoes and green chilies to the pot and cook until the tomatoes are soft and oil starts to separate.
                Add marinated chicken pieces along with the marinade to the pot. Cook until the chicken is partially cooked and the masala thickens.
                Layering:
                
                In a heavy-bottomed pan or biryani pot, spread a layer of cooked rice evenly at the bottom.
                Spread a layer of cooked chicken masala on top of the rice.
                Sprinkle chopped fresh coriander and mint leaves, and fried onions (if using) over the chicken layer.
                Repeat the layers until all the rice and chicken masala are used up, ending with a layer of rice on top.
                Final Steps:
                
                Drizzle the saffron-infused milk over the top layer of rice for a golden color and aromatic flavor (optional).
                Cover the pot tightly with a lid or aluminum foil to seal in the steam.
                Place the pot over low heat and cook for about 20-25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have melded together.
                Serve:
                
                Once the biryani is cooked, gently fluff up the rice layers with a fork.
                Serve hot with raita (yogurt sauce), salad, or your favorite accompaniments.</p></td>
            <td><h3>Brownies</h3><br><img src="brownies.jpg" alt="img"><br><p>Ingredients:

                1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter
                1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
                2 large eggs
                1 teaspoon vanilla extract
                1/3 cup (40g) unsweetened cocoa powder
                1/2 cup (65g) all-purpose flour
                1/4 teaspoon salt
                1/4 teaspoon baking powder
                1/2 cup (90g) chocolate chips or chopped chocolate (optional)
                Optional toppings: chopped nuts, extra chocolate chips, sea salt flakes
                Instructions:
                
                Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease or line an 8x8 inch (20x20 cm) baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides for easy removal.
                
                Melt Butter: In a microwave-safe bowl or a small saucepan, melt the butter until fully melted.
                
                Mix Wet Ingredients: In a mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and granulated sugar. Stir until well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and whisk until smooth.
                
                Add Dry Ingredients: Sift in the cocoa powder, all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder into the wet ingredients mixture. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
                
                Add Chocolate Chips (Optional): Fold in the chocolate chips or chopped chocolate into the batter. This step is optional but adds extra chocolatey goodness to your brownies!
                
                Pour Batter: Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it out evenly with a spatula.
                
                Bake: Bake the brownies in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs attached. Be careful not to overbake, as you want the brownies to be moist and fudgy.
                
                Cool: Allow the brownies to cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Once cooled, lift the brownies out of the pan using the parchment paper overhang and transfer them to a cutting board.
                
                Slice and Serve: Slice the brownies into squares or rectangles using a sharp knife. Optionally, top with chopped nuts, extra chocolate chips, or a sprinkle of sea salt flakes before serving.
                
                Enjoy: Serve your homemade chocolate brownies with a glass of milk or a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an extra indulgent treat! Store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to several days.</p></td>

                For Halwa (Semolina Pudding):
                
                1 cup fine semolina (sooji/rava)
                1/2 cup sugar
                2 cups water
                2-3 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
                1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
                Nuts (such as almonds, cashews, pistachios) for garnish (optional)
                For Chana Masala (Chickpea Curry):
                
                1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked overnight (or use canned chickpeas)
                1 onion, finely chopped
                2 tomatoes, finely chopped
                2-3 green chilies, slit lengthwise
                1-inch piece of ginger, grated
                3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds
                1 teaspoon coriander powder
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1/2 teaspoon red chili powder
                1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
                Salt to taste
                Fresh coriander leaves for garnish
                Instructions:
                
                For Puri:
                
                In a mixing bowl, add whole wheat flour and gradually add water, kneading to form a smooth and stiff dough.
                Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.
                Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball into a small circle (approximately 3-4 inches in diameter).
                Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in the rolled puris one by one.
                Fry the puris until they puff up and turn golden brown on both sides. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining dough balls.
                For Halwa:
                
                Heat ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add semolina and roast it until it turns golden brown and fragrant, stirring continuously to prevent burning.
                In a separate saucepan, bring water to a boil. Gradually add the boiled water to the roasted semolina, stirring continuously to avoid lumps.
                Add sugar and cardamom powder to the semolina mixture and continue to cook, stirring continuously, until the halwa thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.
                Remove the halwa from heat and transfer it to a serving dish. Garnish with chopped nuts if desired.
                For Chana Masala:
                
                If using dried chickpeas, drain and rinse them after soaking overnight. If using canned chickpeas, rinse them under cold water.
                Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.
                Add chopped onions, grated ginger, and minced garlic to the pan. Saute until the onions turn golden brown.
                Add chopped tomatoes, green chilies, and spices (coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, salt). Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil starts to separate.
                Add the soaked (or canned) chickpeas to the pan along with some water. Cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes until the chickpeas are cooked through and the curry thickens.
                Garnish the chana masala with fresh coriander leaves before serving.</p></td>
            <td><h3>Shami kabab</h3><br><img src="shami.jpg" alt="img"><br><p>Ingredients:

                250g boneless beef or mutton, cut into small pieces
                1/2 cup chana dal (split Bengal gram lentils), washed and soaked for 2-3 hours
                1 medium onion, chopped
                2-3 green chilies, chopped
                2-3 cloves of garlic
                1-inch piece of ginger
                1 teaspoon cumin seeds
                1 teaspoon coriander seeds
                1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
                1-2 black cardamom pods
                2-3 cloves
                1-inch piece of cinnamon stick
                1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
                1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
                1 teaspoon garam masala powder
                Salt to taste
                Fresh coriander leaves, chopped
                Fresh mint leaves, chopped
                Oil for frying
                Instructions:
                
                Cook Meat and Lentils:
                
                In a pressure cooker or a large pot, add the boneless meat pieces, soaked chana dal, chopped onion, green chilies, garlic cloves, and ginger.
                Add enough water to cover the ingredients and cook until the meat and lentils are tender. If using a pressure cooker, cook for about 15-20 minutes after the pressure builds up. If using a pot, cook covered over medium heat until the meat and lentils are soft and cooked through.
                Prepare Spice Mix:
                
                While the meat and lentils are cooking, dry roast the whole spices (cumin seeds, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, black cardamom pods, cloves, and cinnamon stick) in a small pan until fragrant. Allow them to cool, then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.
                Mash Meat and Lentils:
                
                Once the meat and lentils are cooked, drain any excess water and allow them to cool slightly.
                Transfer the cooked meat and lentils to a large mixing bowl and mash them together using a potato masher or fork until they form a smooth paste-like consistency.
                Add Spices and Herbs:
                
                To the mashed meat and lentil mixture, add the ground spice mix, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, chopped fresh coriander leaves, and chopped mint leaves. Mix well to combine all the ingredients evenly. Adjust salt and spices to taste.
                Shape Kababs:
                
                Take a small portion of the mixture and shape it into a flat round or oval-shaped kabab using your hands. Repeat with the remaining mixture to make all the kababs.
                Fry Kababs:
                
                Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the shaped kababs in the pan, making sure not to overcrowd them.
                Fry the kababs until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides, flipping them gently halfway through the cooking process. It may take about 3-4 minutes on each side.
                Serve:
                
                Once the kababs are cooked to your desired level of crispiness, remove them from the pan and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.
                Serve the hot Shami Kababs with mint chutney, sliced onions, and lemon wedges. They make a delicious appetizer or snack!</p></td>

                1/2 cup basmati rice
                4 cups whole milk
                1/2 cup sugar (adjust to taste)
                1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
                A pinch of saffron strands (optional)
                2 tablespoons chopped nuts (almonds, cashews, pistachios, etc.)
                1 tablespoon raisins (optional)
                1 tablespoon ghee (clarified butter)
                Instructions:
                
                Rinse Rice: Wash the basmati rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.
                
                Cook Rice: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add the rinsed rice to the boiling water and cook until the rice is soft and fully cooked. Drain any excess water and set the cooked rice aside.
                
                Boil Milk: In the same saucepan, pour the whole milk and bring it to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.
                
                Add Rice: Once the milk comes to a boil, add the cooked rice to the saucepan. Stir well to combine.
                
                Simmer: Reduce the heat to low and let the rice and milk mixture simmer, stirring occasionally, until the kheer thickens to your desired consistency. This may take about 30-40 minutes. Make sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the pan to prevent sticking.
                
                Add Sugar and Flavorings: Once the kheer has thickened, add sugar, cardamom powder, and saffron strands (if using). Stir well until the sugar dissolves completely.
                
                Roast Nuts: In a separate small pan, heat ghee over medium heat. Add chopped nuts and raisins (if using) and roast until the nuts turn golden brown and fragrant.
                
                Garnish: Add the roasted nuts and raisins to the kheer and mix well. Reserve some nuts for garnishing the top if desired.
                
                Serve: Remove the kheer from heat and let it cool slightly. Serve the Rice Kheer warm or chilled, garnished with additional chopped nuts if desired.</p></td>

            <td><h3>Jalebi</h3><br><img src="jalebi.jpg" alt="img"><br><p>Ingredients:

                For Batter:
                
                1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)
                2 tablespoons gram flour (besan)
                1 tablespoon yogurt (plain)
                1/2 teaspoon baking powder
                1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder (for color, optional)
                1 tablespoon ghee or melted butter
                Water, as needed
                Saffron strands (kesar), a pinch (optional, for color)
                For Sugar Syrup:
                
                1 cup sugar
                1/2 cup water
                1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder
                A few saffron strands (kesar), soaked in 1 tablespoon warm milk (optional)
                For Frying:
                
                Oil or ghee for deep frying
                Instructions:
                
                Preparing the Batter:
                
                In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, gram flour, yogurt, baking powder, turmeric powder (if using), ghee or melted butter, and a pinch of saffron strands (if using).
                Gradually add water while stirring continuously to form a smooth batter. The consistency should be similar to pancake batter. Cover the batter and let it rest for 12-15 hours or overnight at room temperature for fermentation.
                Making the Sugar Syrup:
                
                In a saucepan, combine sugar and water. Heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves completely, stirring occasionally.
                Once the sugar has dissolved, add cardamom powder and saffron-infused milk (if using). Stir well and simmer the syrup for a few minutes until it reaches a one-thread consistency. Turn off the heat and keep the syrup warm.
                Frying the Jalebis:
                
                Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium heat. The oil should be moderately hot, not smoking hot.
                Fill a piping bag or a squeeze bottle with the fermented jalebi batter.
                Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a circular motion to form concentric circles or swirls. Alternatively, you can make small spirals or shapes as desired.
                Fry the jalebis until they turn crisp and golden brown on both sides. Use a slotted spoon to gently flip them over if necessary.
                Once fried, remove the jalebis from the oil and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for about 30 seconds to 1 minute, ensuring they are coated well with the syrup.
                Remove the soaked jalebis from the syrup and place them on a wire rack or a plate lined with absorbent paper towels to drain off excess syrup.
                Repeat the frying and dipping process with the remaining batter.
                Serve the jalebis warm or at room temperature. Enjoy the crispy, sweet, and syrupy jalebis as a delightful treat!</p></td>
